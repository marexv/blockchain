# Simple Blockchain implementation

Code taken from Medium tutorial [Learn Blockchain by building one](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) by [Daniel van Flymen](https://github.com/dvf) I wanted to write it down line by line hence I didn't fork his project from github.

# How to run:

1. `$ cd ../desired_folder`
2. `$ virtualenv -p python3.6 venv`
3. `$ source venv/bin/activate`
4. clone this project
5. `pip install requirements.txt`
6. `python python blokchain.py -p 5000`
    - run in several terminals with different ports to simulate network (e.g. -p 5001, -p 5002, etc...)
7. Install [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
8. Open postman and click on import in top left corner, drag'n'drop postman collection
9. Start experimenting...
